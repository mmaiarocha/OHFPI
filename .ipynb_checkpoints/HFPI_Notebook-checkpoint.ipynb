    "The Wind Tunnel provides a directory with a set of Scanivalve files, one file per wind direction. The so-called _Master Table_ connects the Scanivalve channels in each file to the corresponding pressure taps in the model. The _Master Table_ also provides further information for pressure integration over building surface. \n",

The tunnel is configured according to a specified setup for both close field neighborhood and far field terrain roughness. The setup defines the wind turbulence reaching the model. A single building model may be tested for more than on setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scanivalve files must be preprocessed to become associated with model taps. The files give the instantaneous pressure at each channel in the data acquisition system. To link the channels to pressure taps a _Master Table_ must provide the complete mapping. The _Master Table_ has one line for each tap, plus two lines for the reference pressures $A_1$ and $A_2$ (related to the instantaneous velocity in the tunnel). The table columns bring all required tap information, as described bellow.\n",
